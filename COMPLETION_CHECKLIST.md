## 📝 Common Questions to Prepare

### Technical Questions

1. **"Why did you choose HMM for regime detection?"**
   - Answer: Captures hidden market states, handles non-stationarity, probabilistic framework

2. **"How do you handle overfitting in your ML models?"**
   - Answer: Train-test split, cross-validation, regularization, early stopping

3. **"What's the significance of options Greeks in your strategy?"**
   - Answer: Forward-looking, capture market sentiment, provide volatility insights

4. **"How would you improve this system?"**
   - Answer: Real-time data, ensemble models, portfolio optimization, transaction costs

5. **"What are the main risks in your strategy?"**
   - Answer: Regime misclassification, model overfitting, execution slippage, market regime changes

### Business Questions

1. **"Is this strategy profitable in real trading?"**
   - Answer: Backtest shows promise, but needs live testing, transaction costs, slippage consideration

2. **"How much capital would you need to trade this?"**
   - Answer: Minimum ₹10 lakhs for diversification, position sizing, risk management

3. **"What's your edge in this strategy?"**
   - Answer: Regime awareness, options integration, ML filtering, risk management

4. **"How often would you retrain the models?"**
   - Answer: Monthly for regime detection, weekly for ML models, or when performance degrades
