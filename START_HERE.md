## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About Data
- System uses **synthetic data** for demonstration
- This is intentional and professional
- Shows you can handle data generation
- For production, you'd use real data APIs

### About Results
- Results are realistic but synthetic
- Focus on **methodology** not absolute numbers
- Interviewers care about **approach** not profits

### About Time
- First run: 5-10 minutes
- Understanding code: 2-3 hours
- Preparing presentation: 3-4 hours
- **Total investment: ~1 day for complete mastery**

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Common Issues

**"Import errors"**
→ Make sure virtual environment is activated
→ Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**"No module named 'src'"**
→ Run from project root directory
→ Check you're in the right folder

**"Out of memory"**
→ Edit `src/config.py`
→ Reduce date range (e.g., 180 days instead of 365)

**"Results look wrong"**
→ This is synthetic data, results may vary
→ Focus on methodology, not absolute numbers

### Where to Find Answers

- **Setup issues** → `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- **Technical questions** → `METHODOLOGY.md`
- **Commands** → `COMMANDS.md`
- **Navigation** → `PROJECT_MAP.md`
